(2013) have recently disproved a conjecture by Schwartz (1990) by non-constructively showing the existence of a counterexample with about $10^{136}$ alternatives. We provide a concrete counterexample for Schwartz's conjecture with only $24$ alternatives.\n\\section{Introduction}\nA tournament $T$ is a pair $(A,\\lambda)$, where $A$ is a set of alternatives and $\\lambda$ is an asymmetric and complete (and thus inflexive) binary relation on $A$, usually referred to as the dominance relation. The dominance relation can be extended to sets of alternatives by writing $X\\succ Y$ when $x\\succ y$ for all $x\\in X$ and $y\\in Y$. For a tournament $(A,\\lambda)$, an alternative $x\\in A$, and a subset $X\\subseteq A$ of alternatives, we denote by $D_X(x)=\\{y\\in X\\mid y\\succ x\\}$ the dominators of $x$. A tournament solution is a function that maps a tournament to a nonempty subset of its alternatives (see, e.g., Laslier, 1997, for further information). Given a tournament $T=(A,\\lambda)$ and a tournament solution $S$, a nonempty subset of alternatives $X\\subseteq A$ is called $S$-reductive if $S(D_A(x))\\subset X$ for all $x\\in X$ such that $D_A(x)\\neq\\emptyset$. Schwartz (1990) defined the tournament equilibrium set (TEQ) of a given tournament $T=(A,\\lambda)$ recursively as the union of all inclusion-minimal TEQ-reductive sets in $T$.\nSchwartz conjectured that every tournament contains a unique inclusion-minimal TEQ-reductive set, which was later shown to be equivalent to TEQ satisfying any one of a number of desirable properties for tournament solutions (Lafond et al., 1993; Houy, 2009a,b; Brandt et al., 2010a; Brandt, 2011b; Brandt and Harrenstein, 2011; Brandt, 2011a). This conjecture was recently disproved by Brandt et al. (2013) who have shown the existence of a counterexample with about $10^{136}$ alternatives using the probabilistic method. Since the above mentioned proposition was not considered in the literature, it was shown that the above proposition was not considered in the literature.\n\\section{Preliminaries}\nLet $X$ be a set of alternatives and $\\lambda$ be a set of $\\lambda$-reductive sets.

We show that the velocity field associated with the rotation of the fluid exhibits diffused vorticity, in contrast to the irrotational behavior characterizing a superfluid. Both Raman-induced and Rashba spin-orbit couplings are considered. In the first case the moment of inertia takes the rigid value at the transition between the plane wave and the single minimum phase, while in the latter case the rigid value is achieved in the limit of isotropic Rashba coupling. A procedure to generate the rigid rotation of the fluid and to measure the moment of inertia is proposed. The quenching of the quantum of circulation $h/m$, caused by Raman induced spin-orbit coupling in a toroidal geometry, is also discussed.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\n\\textit{Introduction.} Irrotationality is one of the most important features exhibited by superfluids \\cite{Hosur,Hosur2}. It is at the origin of phenomena of fundamental relevance that have been confirmed experimentally both in superfluid helium and in ultracold atomic gases, like the quenching of the moment of inertia and the occurrence of quantized vortices. At small angular velocities the formation of quantized vortices is energetically inhibited and the moment of inertia of a superfluid, in the presence of isotropic confinement, vanishes at zero temperature as a consequence of the irrotationality of the velocity field. In Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) the condition of irrotationality is usually associated with the phase $\\phi$ of the order parameter, whose gradient fixes the superfluid velocity according to the relationship $v=(\\hbar/m)\\nabla\\phi$, where $m$ is the mass of atoms. However, even at $T=0$, the above irrotationality condition is violated in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, as we will discuss in the present Letter, with important consequences on the rotational behavior of the system.\nRaman-induced spin-orbit coupled Bose gases, characterized by equal Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling, have been the object of systematic experimental and theoretical work in the recent years, following the pioneering experimental realization of \\cite{Dresselhaus} (for recent reviews see, for example, \\cite{Dresselhaus2,Dresselhaus3}). These configurations are characterized by the breaking of Galilean invariance which is responsible for important consequences like, for example, the breakdown of Landau's criterion for the critical velocity \\cite{Landau,Landau1,Landau2}. Using Bogoliubov theory and sum rule arguments it has been recently shown \\cite{Dresselhaus} that the normal (nonsuperfluid) density of these systems does not vanish at zero temperature, as happens in usual superfluids. In particular the normal density was calculated as a function of the Raman coupling produced by two lasers that couple two different hyperfine states, transferring momentum $\\hbar k_0$. The effect is largest at the transition between the plane-wave phase and the single-minimum phase, where the motion of the fluid along the axis fixed by $k_0$, completely loses its superfluid nature even at $T=0$, despite the fact that the system is practically fully Bose-Einstein condensed \\cite{Landau}.\nThe purpose of this letter is to investigate the rotational properties of spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensed gas employing a generalized hydrodynamic formalism, allowing for analytic solutions in the presence of harmonic trapping. In particular we prove the existence of a spin-orbit coupling of the system, which is the first one, the motion of the fluid along the axis of the system, and the second one, the motion of the superfluid along the axis of the system, which is the first one, the second one, the second one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one, the third one[SEP]", "[PAD]\\importpackages{}\n\\graphicspath{ {./images/} }\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\\section{Introduction}\nWhen the fermion zero modes localized on the surface or on the topological defects are studied in topological media, the investigation is mainly concentrated on the fully gapped topological media, such as topological insulators and superfluids/superconductors of the $^3$He-B type \\cite{Fu,Qi,Fu2}. However, the gapless topological media may also have fermion zero modes with interesting properties, in particular they may have the dispersionless branch of spectrum with zero energy -- the flat band \\cite{Fu2,Fu3}.\nThe dispersionless bands, where the energy vanishes in a finite region of the momentum space, have been discussed in different systems. Originally the flat band has been discussed in the fermionic condensate -- the Khodel state \\cite{Khodel,Volovik,Volovik2,Volovik3}, and for fermion zero modes localized in the core of vortices in superfluid $^3$He-A \\cite{Volovik4,Volovik5,Volovik6}. The flat band has also been discussed on the surface of the multi-layered graphene (see \\cite{Volovik7,Volovik8} and references therein). In particle physics, the Fermi band (called the Fermi ball) appears in a 2+1 dimensional nonrelativistic quantum field theory which is dual to a gravitational theory in the anti-de Sitter background with a charged black hole \\cite{Volovik8}.\nRecently it was realized that the flat band can be topologically protected in gapless topological matter. It appears in the 3D systems which contain the nodal lines in the form of closed loops \\cite{Volovik3} or in the form of spirals \\cite{Volovik4}. In these systems the surface flat band emerges on the surface of topological matter. The boundary of the surface flat band is bounded by the projection of the nodal loop or nodal spiral onto the corresponding surface. Here we extend this bulk-surface correspondence to the bulk-vortex correspondence, which relates the flat band of fermion zero modes in the vortex core to the topology of the point nodes (Dirac or Fermi points) in the bulk 3D topological superfluids.\n\\section{Vortex-disgoration}\nAs generic example we consider topological defect in 3D spinless chiral superfluid/superconductor of the $^3$He-A type, which contains two Fermi points (Dirac points).

By modeling the groundtruth as random variables, the concepts of absolute and relative error are generalized to be likelihood. Moreover, the groundtruth is represented as a piecewise Gaussian Process in continuous-time. Within this framework, we are able to establish theoretical connections between relative and absolute error metrics and handle temporal association in a principled manner.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\section{INTRODUCTION}\nVisual-(inertial) odometry (VO/VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are important building blocks in robotic systems, as they provide accurate state estimate for other tasks, such as control and planning. To benchmark such algorithms, the most used method is to evaluate the estimated trajectory (i.e., timestamped pose series) with respect to the groundtruth.\nThe central task for trajectory evaluation is to summarize certain metrics from the estimate and the groundtruth to indicate the performance. There are many established evaluation methods, most notably the absolute trajectory error (ATE) \\cite{khan2016accuracy} and the relative error (RE) \\cite{khan2017spatial}. While these methods are widely used in practice and can be indicative of the performance, there are still many open problems.\nSpecifically, in this paper, we are interested in the following:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item It is well known that different metrics reflect different properties of estimate \\cite{khan2017spatial}. However, the connection between them is not clear. Indeed, it is observed in practice that relative and absolute errors are often highly correlated (e.g., \\cite{khan2016accuracy}), but no theoretical proof has been proposed before.\n    \\item Almost all the existing methods assume perfect temporal correspondences or adopt a naive matching strategy. For example, to find the corresponding groundtruth of the estimate at time $t$, most tools simply use the closest groundtruth, which is only acceptable when the groundtruth is of sufficiently high temporal resolution. There is no principled method currently to take into consideration of the imperfect temporal association, which can in practice have an impact for low rate groundtruth providers or missing data.\n\\end{enumerate}\nIn this work, we proposes to formulate the trajectory evaluation in a probabilistic, continuous-time framework. First, instead of considering the groundtruth as deterministic values, we model it as random variables and thus generalize the concepts of absolute and relative error as likelihood. While this step seems trivial (e.g., sum of squared error is simply the likelihood from Gaussian uncertainties), this allows us to draw connection between relative and absolute error (Section \\ref{sec:Gaussian}). Second, to reason about temporal association in a principled manner, we propose to use Gaussian Process (GP) to represent the groundtruth. As a probabilistic and continuous-time representation, GP reports uncertainty for any query time, which, for example, gives higher uncertainties for query times far away from the actual groundtruth samples. In this way, the effect of imperfect temporal association can be handled elegantly, which is not possible with many other continuous-time representations, such as polynomials.\nIt is well known that the trajectory evaluation problem is mainly complicated by the unobservable degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) in the estimator \\cite{khan2017spatial}, and thus is specific to different sensing modalities. For simplicity, throughout the paper, we present the framework for trajectory estimates with unknown rigid-body transformations (e.g., stereo or RGB-D sensors). However, our method can be adapted to other interesting setups (monocular, visual-inertial) in future work.\n\\subsection{Contributions and Outline}\nThe contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item We propose to formulate the trajectory evaluation problem in a[SEP]", "[PAD]\\importpackages{}\n\\graphicspath{ {./images/} }\n\n\n\\title{Binary Diversity for Non-Binary LDPC Codes over the Rayleigh Channel}\n\\author{\\IEEEauthorblockN{Matteo Gorgoglione\\IEEEauthorrefmark{1}, Valentin Savin\\IEEEauthorrefmark{1}, David Declercq\\IEEEauthorrefmark{4}}\n\\IEEEauthorblockA{\\IEEEauthorrefmark{1}CEA-LETI, Minatec Campus, Grenoble, France \\{matteo.gorgoglione, valentin.savin\\}@cea.fr}\n\\IEEEauthorblockA{\\IEEEauthorrefmark{4}ETIS, ENSEA Univ.

The technique of bit-interleaving used over fading channel introduces diversity which could provide important gains in terms of frame error probability and detection. This paper demonstrates the importance of the way of implementing the bit-interleaving, and proposes a design of an optimized bit-interleaver inspired from the Progressive Edge Growth algorithm. This optimization algorithm depends on the topological structure of a given LDPC code and can also be applied to any degree distribution and code realization. In particular, we focus on non-binary LDPC codes based on graph with constant symbol-node connection $dv=2$. These regular $(2,dc)$-NB-LDPC codes demonstrate best performance, thanks to their large girths and improved decoding thresholds growing with the order of Finite Field. Simulations show excellent results of the proposed interleaving technique compared to the random interleaver as well as to the system without interleaver.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\IEEEpeerreviewmaketitle\n\\section{Introduction}\nSince their rediscovery by MacKay \\cite{MacKay} in 1996, Low-Density Parity-Check codes have attracted a lot of attention because they exhibit rates close to the Shannon capacity \\cite{Shannon} for many transmission channels, despite their low decoding complexity. With the evolution of the technology, new families of LDPC codes defined on non-binary alphabets have been proposed and studied. They demonstrate better performance with respect to the binary case, especially for moderate code lengths \\cite{LDPC} but at the expense of more complex decoding architectures.\nNon-binary LDPC codes can be defined by considering a non-binary alphabet $A$, which for practical reasons is often considered to be endowed with a vector-space structure over the binary field $F_2=\\{0,1\\}$, and a semigroup $G$ acting on $A$. A non-binary code of length $N$ is hence defined as the set of solutions $s\\in A$ of a linear system $H_{s_T}=0$, where $H$ is a matrix with coefficients in $G$, referred to as the parity-check matrix of the code.\nLDPC codes are decoded using the belief propagation (BP) algorithm based on an iterative exchange of messages between nodes \\cite{BP,BP2}.\nThe case of codes for which the underlying bipartite graph is ultra-sparse, in the sense that each symbol-node is connected to exactly $dv=2$ linear constraint-nodes, is of particular interest. First, very large girths can be obtained for Tanner graphs with $dv=2$, as demonstrated in \\cite{LDPC2,LDPC3}. It has also been pointed out \\cite{LDPC4,LDPC5} that when the size of the non-binary alphabet grows, best decoding thresholds are obtained for average density of edges closer and closer to $dv=2$.\nPractically, for NB-LDPC codes defined over Galois fields $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q\\geq64$, best codes, both asymptotically and at finite lengths, are ultra-sparse codes. Despite those advantages, the ultra-sparse LDPC codes in $\\mathbb{F}_q$ suffer from a serious drawback, as their minimum distance is limited and grows at best as $O(\\log(N))$ \\cite{LDPC5}. This limitation is however not critical when the desired error rate is above $10^{-5}$, which is the case of the wireless transmissions that we target in this paper[SEP]", "[PAD]\\importpackages{}\n\\graphicspath{ {./images/} }\n\n\n\\title{Aharonov-Casher effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ square-ring interferometers}\n\\author{Fanming Qu}\n\\author{Fan Yang}\n\\author{Jun Chen}\n\\author{Jie Shen}\n\\author{Yue Ding}\n\\author{Jiangbo Lu}\n\\author{Yuanjun Song}\n\\author{Huaixin Yang}\n\\author{Guangtong Liu}\n\\author{Jie Fan}\n\\author{Yongqing Li}\n\\author{Zhongqing Ji}\n\\author{Changli Yang}\n\\author{Li Lu}\n\\email{luli@iphy.ac.cn}\n\\affiliation{Daniel Chee Tsui Laboratory, Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, People's Republic of China}\n\\date{\\today}\n\\begin{abstract}\nElectrical control of spin dynamics in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ was investigated in ring-type interferometers.

By tuning applied gate voltage one can rotate the spin of a moving electron with purely electrical means rather than traditionally with magnetic fields. The devices ever proposed and studied include the Datta-Das spin field effect transistors based on Rashba SOC \\cite{Rashba, Rashba2}, the spin interferometers and filters \\cite{Rashba2, Rashba3, Rashba4, Rashba5, Rashba6} via Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect \\cite{AC}, and the quantum-dot spin qubits using electrical pulse to control the spin precession \\cite{QT, QT2, QT3}, etc. Since the tunability of spin rotation by applied gate voltage relies on the strength of SOC, materials with stronger SOC would preferably be chosen to construct devices in this regard.\nTopological insulators (TIs) \\cite{TI1,TI2,TI3} are a new class of materials with strong SOC. The SOC in TIs is so strong that it leads to the formation of helical electron states at the surface/edge with inter-locked momentum and spin degrees of freedom. Many novel properties of TIs have been observed, including the formation of Dirac fermions \\cite{TI4,TI5,TI6,TI7}, suppression of backscattering \\cite{backscattering}, and the appearance of weak anti-localization (WAL) \\cite{WAL1, WAL2, WAL3, WAL4, WAL5}. With such a novel electron system caused by strong SOC, electrical control of spin dynamics in TIs becomes a particularly interesting issue. Previously, Molenkamp group has studied the spin interference in a ring device made of HgTe/HgCdTe quantum well, a material which could be tuned into a two-dimensional (2D) TI, and reached a tunability higher than that in devices based on InAlAs/InGaAs two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) \\cite{Rashba2, Rashba6}. Here we report our investigation on the electrical control of spin dynamics in a square-ring type of interferometer based on Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a material which could eventually be tuned into a 3D TI. The tunability of spin precession by gate voltage is found to be significantly higher than that reported before.\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ nanoplates were synthesized in a 2-inch horizontal tube furnace via a chemical vapor deposition method similar to literature \\cite{HgTe}.

Kribs}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706}\n\\email{kribs@physics.wisc.edu}\n\\begin{abstract}\nA simple argument based on an SU(3) gauged horizontal symmetry is presented that connects the explanation for three generations of matter with the existence of a triplet of right-handed neutrinos. This rationale for right-handed neutrinos is analogous to, but completely independent of, grand unification or extra universal dimensions. A brief discussion of the supersymmetrized SU(3) model is also given, pointing out that certain problems in ordinary supersymmetric models such as fast proton decay via dimension-5 Planck-suppressed operators can be naturally solved.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\nOne of the most remarkable features of the Standard Model (SM) is that matter fermions are chiral and yet all gauge~\\cite{Weinberg:1978xd,Weinberg:1978xw} and gravitational~\\cite{Weinberg:1978yv} anomalies vanish for each generation. A known but not often emphasized fact about the matter content is that, given one generation with unfixed hypercharges, anomaly cancellation determines the relative hypercharge assignment to be precisely what has been established by experiment~\\cite{Weinberg:1978yv}. In other words, electric charge quantization is essentially automatic without grand unification. This fact, taken at face value, is circumstantial evidence against the existence of right-handed neutrinos. By definition a candidate for a right-handed neutrino is any fermion that is uncharged under all of the SM gauge symmetries. Yet, gauge symmetries are precisely the reason that each type of matter $(Q,u,d,L,e)$ is tied with the other matter fields together in a self-consistent, exclusive fashion. In addition, non-chiral matter allows a new mass scale unconnected to electroweak symmetry breaking that only further complicates our understanding of mass generation and mass hierarchies. Extensions of the SM with non-chiral matter, such as adding right-handed neutrinos, therefore appear to be contrary to all of the guiding wisdom gleaned from experiment, at least until recently. (Those who are still in doubt need only observe the emptor that the $\\mu$ problem causes avatars of supersymmetry.)\nNeutrino experiments~\\cite{Aguilar:2001sx,Aguilar:2002sx,Aguilar:2002sx}, however, have firmly established that the neutrinos oscillate between each generation and thus they have mass. The largest mass of any one neutrino is constrained to be less than about 2 eV~\\cite{Aguilar:2002sx}, and more likely their mass is one to a few orders of magnitude below this, depending on the generation. The mechanism of mass generation for neutrinos remains a mystery. If neutrinos acquire mass analogously to the SM matter fermions, preserving lepton number, then the particle content must be extended with at least two right-handed neutrinos $\\nu_{1,2}$. Ordinary Yukawa terms $L=\\lambda_\\nu L H_\\nu c$ with tiny couplings $\\lambda_\\nu \\lesssim 10^{-12}$ suffice to explain the two undisputed mass differences found in neutrino oscillation experiments.\nBut, the global symmetry behind lepton number conservation is not expected to be exact. At dimension-5, the operator $H_{HL}/M$ violates lepton number by two units and leads to a tiny Majorana mass $v_2/M$ for left-handed neutrinos. This transmutes the neutrino mass hierarchy problem from explaining $\\lambda_\\nu \\lesssim 10^{-12}$ to instead explaining $v/M \\lesssim 10^{-12}$. To embrace the dimension-5 neutrino mass explanation means the SM effective theory breaks down at $M \\lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV. This is somewhat disconcerting since there are dimension-6 operators that violate lepton and baryon number, leading to a proton decay rate that is excluded by experiment unless $M \\gtrsim 10^{16}$ GeV. Hence, while lepton number must be be violated at $M$ to explain neutrino masses, baryon number must be preserved to keep the proton stable. The simplest phenomenological explanation for lepton number violation without baryon number violation at the cutoff is the[SEP]", "[PAD]\\importpackages{}\n\\graphicspath{ {./images/} }\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\\begin{abstract}\nLet $M$ be a compact manifold of dimension at least 2. If $M$ admits a minimal homeomorphism then $M$ admits a minimal noninvertible map.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\section{Introduction}\nFathi and Herman \\cite{Fathi} showed that every compact connected manifold which admits a smooth, locally free effective action of the circle group has a smooth diffeomorphism, isotopic to the identity, which is minimal, and so all odd dimensional spheres admit a minimal diffeomorphism (see also \\cite{Fathi2}). Every manifold that admits a minimal flow admits also a minimal homeomorphism. The converse does not hold even in dimension 2, as manifested on the Klein bottle \\cite{Klein}. Less is known about the existence of minimal noninvertible maps. The circle does not admit such maps, despite admitting minimal rotations \\cite{Fathi}. Both the 2-torus and Klein bottle admit minimal noninvertible maps \\cite{Fathi2,Fathi3}, but in dimension at least 3 it has not been known which manifolds admit minimal noninvertible maps. By application of a result of B\\'{e}guin, Crovisier and Le Roux \\cite{B\\'{e}guin}, here we show in Theorem \\ref{main} that any compact manifold of dimension at least 2 admits a minimal noninvertible map if it admits a minimal homeomorphism.\n\\section{Preliminaries}\nA self map $f:X\\rightarrow X$ of a compact metric space is said to be \\emph{minimal} if for ever point $x\\in X$ the forward orbit $\\{f^n(x):n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ is dense in $X$.\n\\subsection{A Denjoy-type result}\nThe following result was obtained in \\cite{B\\'{e}guin}, p.304, as a corollary of a far-reaching generalization of the Denjoy-Rees technique.

We show that the velocity field associated with the rotation of the fluid exhibits  diffused vorticity,   in contrast to the irrotational behavior characterizing a superfluid. Both Raman-induced and Rashba spin-orbit couplings are considered. In the first case the moment of inertia   takes  the rigid value at the transition between the plane wave and the single minimum phase, while in the latter case the rigid value is achieved in the limit of isotropic Rashba coupling. A procedure to generate the rigid rotation of the fluid and to measure the moment of inertia is proposed. The quenching of the quantum of circulation $h/m$, caused by Raman induced spin-orbit coupling  in a toroidal geometry, is also discussed. \n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\n{\\em Introduction.}\nIrrotationality is one of the most important features exhibited by  superfluids \\cite{Leggett2006,LS2003}. It is at the origin of phenomena of fundamental  relevance that have been confirmed  experimentally both in superfluid helium and in ultracold atomic  gases, like the quenching of the moment of inertia and the occurrence of quantized vortices. At small angular velocities the formation of quantized vortices is energetically inhibited and the moment of inertia of a superfluid, in the presence of isotropic confinement,  vanishes  at zero temperature as a consequence of the irrotationality of the velocity field. In Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) the condition of irrotationality is usually associated with the phase  $\\phi$ of the order parameter, whose gradient fixes the superfluid velocity according to the    relationship ${\\bf v} = (\\hbar/m)\\nabla \\phi$, where $m$ is the mass of atoms.  However, even at $T=0$,  the above irrotationality condition is violated in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, as we will discuss in the present Letter, with important consequences on the rotational behavior of the system.  \n Raman-induced spin-orbit coupled Bose gases, characterized by equal Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling, have been  the object of systematic experimental and theoretical work in the recent years, following the pioneering experimental realization of  \\cite{Lin2009}  (for recent reviews see, for example, \\cite{YunLi2015,Zhai2015}).  These configurations are characterized by the breaking of Galilean invariance which is responsible for  important consequences like, for example, the breakdown of   Landau's criterion for the critical velocity  \\cite{Zhu2012,Zheng2013,Ozawa2013}. \n Using Bogoliubov theory and sum rule arguments it has been recently shown \\cite{HKTN} that the normal (nonsuperfluid) density  of these systems  does not vanish at zero temperature, as happens in usual superfluids. In particular the normal density was calculated as a function of the Raman coupling produced by two lasers that couple two different  hyperfine states, transferring momentum $\\hbar {\\bf k}_0$. The effect is  largest at the transition between the plane-wave phase and the single-minimum  phase, where the motion of the fluid along the axis  fixed by  ${\\bf k}_0$,   completely loses its superfluid nature even at $T=0$, despite the fact that the system is practically fully  Bose-Einstein condensed \\cite{Zheng2013}. \n \nThe purpose of this letter is to  investigate the rotational properties of   spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensed gas employing a generalized hydrodynamic formalism, allowing for analytic solutions in the presence of harmonic trapping.   In particular   we  prove the existence of rotational solutions, characterized by diffused vorticity  and we calculate   the corresponding value of the moment of inertia \\cite{Fetter}.

Originally the flat band has been discussed in the  fermionic condensate -- the Khodel state \n\\cite{Khodel1990,NewClass,Volovik2007,Shaginyan2010}, and for fermion zero modes localized in the core of vortices in superfluid $^3$He-A  \\cite{KopninSalomaa1991,Volovik1994,MisirpashaevVolovik1995}. The flat band has also been discussed on the surface of the multi-layered graphene (see \\cite{Guinea2006,CastroNeto2009} and references therein). In particle physics, the Fermi band (called the Fermi ball) appears  in  a 2+1 dimensional nonrelativistic quantum field theory which is dual to a gravitational theory in the anti-de Sitter  background with a charged black hole\n\\cite{Sung-SikLee2009}.  \nRecently it was realized that the flat band can be topologically protected in gapless topological matter. It appears in the 3D systems which contain the nodal lines in the form of closed loops  \\cite{SchnyderRyu2010} or in the form of spirals \\cite{HeikkilaVolovik2010b}. In these systems the surface flat band emerges on the surface of topological matter. The boundary of  the surface flat band  is bounded by the projection of the nodal loop or nodal spiral onto the corresponding surface.  Here we extend  this bulk-surface correspondence to the bulk-vortex correspondence, which relates the flat band of fermion zero modes in the vortex core to the topology of the point nodes (Dirac or Fermi points) in the bulk 3D  topological superfluids.  \n\\section{Vortex-disgyration}\n As generic example we consider topological defect in 3D spinless chiral superfluid/superconductor of the $^3$He-A type, which contains two Fermi points (Dirac points).

localization and mapping (SLAM) are important building blocks in robotic systems, as they provide accurate state estimate for other tasks, such as control and planning.\nTo benchmark such algorithms, the most used method is to evaluate the estimated trajectory (\\ie timestamped pose series) with respect to the groundtruth.\nThe central task for trajectory evaluation is to summarize certain metrics from the estimate and the groundtruth to indicate the performance.\nThere are many established evaluation methods, most notably the absolute trajectory error (ATE) \\cite{Sturm12iros} and the relative error (RE) \\cite{Geiger12cvpr}.\nWhile these methods are widely used in practice and can be indicative of the performance, there are still many open problems.\nSpecifically, in this paper, we are interested in the following:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item It is well known that different metrics reflect different properties of estimate \\cite{Zhang18iros}.\nHowever, the connection between them is not clear.\nIndeed, it is observed in practice that relative and absolute errors are often highly correlated (\\eg \\cite{Sturm12iros}),\nbut no theoretical proof has been proposed before.\n\\item Almost all the existing methods assume perfect temporal correspondences or adopt a naive matching strategy.\nFor example, to find the corresponding groundtruth of the estimate at time $t$, most tools simply use the closest groundtruth, which is only acceptable when the groundtruth is of sufficiently high temporal resolution.\nThere is no principled method currently to take into consideration of the imperfect temporal association, which can in practice have an impact for low rate groundtruth providers or missing data.\n\\end{enumerate}\nIn this work, we proposes to formulate the trajectory evaluation in a probabilistic, continuous-time framework.\nFirst, instead of considering the groundtruth as deterministic values, we model it as random variables and thus generalize the concepts of absolute and relative error as likelihood.\nWhile this step seems trivial (e.g., sum of squared error is simply the likelihood from Gaussian uncertainties), this allows us to draw connection between relative and absolute error (\\Sec\\ref{sec:traj_likelihood}).\nSecond, to reason about temporal association in a principled manner, we propose to use Gaussian Process (GP) to represent the groundtruth.\nAs a probabilistic and continuous-time representation, GP reports uncertainty for any query time, which, for example, gives higher uncertainties for query times far away from the actual groundtruth samples.\nIn this way, the effect of imperfect temporal association can be handled elegantly, which is not possible with many other continuous-time representations, such as polynomials.\nIt is well known that the trajectory evaluation problem is mainly complicated by the unobservable degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) in the estimator \\cite{Zhang18iros}, and thus is specific to different sensing modalities.\nFor simplicity, throughout the paper, we present the framework for trajectory estimates with unknown rigid-body transformations (\\eg stereo or RGB-D sensors).\nHowever, our method can be adapted to other interesting setups (monocular, visual-inertial) in future work.\n\\subsection{Contributions and Outline}\nThe contributions of this work are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item we provide the first theoretical proof that draws connection between relative and absolute error.\n\\item the proposed probabilistic, continuous-time framework is the first that is able to handle temporal association properly.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows.\nIn \\Sec\\ref{sec:notations}, we formulate the evaluation problem of interest and introduce essential notations.\nIn \\Sec\\ref{sec:traj_likelihood}, the generalized versions of RE and ATE are derived with the probabilistic[SEP]",

This optimization algorithm depends on the topological structure of a given LDPC code and can also be applied to any degree distribution and code realization.\nIn particular, we focus on non-binary LDPC codes based on graph with constant symbol-node connection $d_v = 2$. These regular $(2,dc)$-NB-LDPC codes demonstrate best performance, thanks to their large girths and improved decoding thresholds growing with the order of Finite Field. Simulations show excellent results of the proposed interleaving technique compared to the random interleaver as well as to the system without interleaver.\n\\textit{Index Terms} $-$ Non-binary LDPC codes, bit-interleaver, Rayleigh fading channel, Tanner Graph.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\section{Introduction}\nSince their rediscovery by MacKay \\cite{MacKay} in 1996, Low-Density Parity-Check codes have attracted a lot of attention because they exhibit rates close to the Shannon capacity \\cite{RichardsonUrbanke} for many transmission channels, despite their low decoding complexity.\nWith the evolution of the technology, new families of LDPC codes defined on non-binary alphabets have been proposed and studied. They demonstrate better performance with respect to the binary case, especially for moderate code lengths \\cite{DaveyMacKay} but at the expense of more complex decoding architectures.\nNon-binary LDPC codes can be defined by considering a non-binary alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$, which for practical reasons is often considered to be endowed with a vector-space structure over the binary field $\\mathbb{F}_2 = \\{ 0, 1 \\}$, and\na semigroup $\\mathcal{G}$ acting on $\\mathcal{A}$. A non-binary code of length $N$ is hence defined as the set of solutions $\\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathcal{A}$ of a linear system $\\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{s}^T = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{H}$ is a matrix with coefficients in $\\mathcal{G}$, referred to as the parity-check matrix of the code.\nLDPC codes are decoded using the belief propagation (BP) algorithm  based on an iterative exchange of messages between nodes \\cite{Gallager,Declercq}.\nThe case of codes for which the underlying bipartite graph is ultra-sparse, in the sense that each symbol-node is connected\nto exactly $d_v = 2$ linear constraint-nodes, is of particular interest.\nFirst, very large girths can be obtained for Tanner graphs with $d_v = 2$, as demonstrated in \\cite{Xiao}, \\cite{Venkiah}.\nIt has also been pointed out \\cite{Sassatelli}, \\cite{DaveyMacKay} that when the size of the non-binary alphabet grows, best decoding thresholds are obtained for average density of edges closer and closer to $d_v = 2$.\nPractically, for NB-LDPC codes defined over Galois fields $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q \\geq [SEP]", "[PAD]\\importpackages{}\n\\graphicspath{ {./images/} }\n\n\n\n\\title{Aharonov-Casher effect in Bi$_{\\rm\n2}$Se$_{\\rm 3}$ square-ring interferometers}\n\n\\author{Fanming Qu}\n\\author{Fan Yang}\n\\author{Jun Chen}\n\\author{Jie Shen}\n\\author{Yue Ding}\n\\author{Jiangbo Lu}\n\\author{Yuanjun Song}\n\\author{Huaixin Yang}\n\\author{Guangtong Liu}\n\\author{Jie Fan}\n\\author{Yongqing Li}\n\\author{Zhongqing Ji}\n\\author{Changli Yang}\n\\author{Li Lu}\n\\email[Corresponding authors: ]{lilu@iphy.ac.cn}\n\n\\affiliation{Daniel Chee Tsui Laboratory, Beijing National\nLaboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics,\nChinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, People's Republic of\nChina}\n\n\\date{\\today}\n             \n\n\\begin{abstract}\nElectrical control of spin dynamics in Bi$_{\\rm 2}$Se$_{\\rm 3}$ was\ninvestigated in ring-type interferometers.

By tuning applied gate voltage one can\nrotate the spin of a moving electron with purely electrical means\nrather than traditionally with magnetic fields. The devices ever\nproposed and studied include the Datta-Das spin field effect\ntransistors based on Rashba SOC \\cite{2,3}, the spin interferometers\nand filters \\cite{4,6,5,7,8,9} via Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect\n\\cite{10}, and the quantum-dot spin qubits using electrical pulse to\ncontrol the spin precession \\cite{11,12,13}, etc. Since the\ntunability of spin rotation by applied gate voltage relies on the\nstrength of SOC, materials with stronger SOC would preferably be\nchosen to construct devices in this regard.\n\nTopological insulators (TIs) \\cite{14,15,16} are a new class of\nmaterials with strong SOC. The SOC in TIs is so strong that it leads\nto the formation of helical electron states at the surface/edge with\ninter-locked momentum and spin degrees of freedom. Many novel\nproperties of TIs have been observed, including the formation of\nDirac fermions \\cite{17,18,19,20}, suppression of backscattering\n\\cite{21}, and the appearance of weak anti-localization (WAL)\n\\cite{22,23,24,25,26}.\n\nWith such a novel electron system caused by strong SOC, electrical\ncontrol of spin dynamics in TIs becomes a particularly interesting\nissue.

A brief discussion of the supersymmetrized SU(3) model \nis also given, pointing out that certain problems in ordinary \nsupersymmetric models such as fast proton decay via dimension-5 \nPlanck-suppressed operators can be naturally solved.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\nOne of the most remarkable features of the Standard Model (SM)\nis that matter fermions are chiral and yet all gauge \n\\cite{gauge,witten} and gravitational \\cite{aw} anomalies \nvanish for each generation.  A known but not often \nemphasized fact about the matter content is that, given\none generation with unfixed hypercharges, anomaly cancellation \ndetermines the relative hypercharge assignment to be precisely\nwhat has been established by experiment \\cite{SManomalies}.  \nIn other words, electric charge quantization is essentially \nautomatic without grand unification.  \nThis fact, taken at face value, is circumstantial evidence\nagainst the existence of right-handed neutrinos.  By definition a \ncandidate for a right-handed neutrino is any fermion that is uncharged \nunder all of the SM gauge symmetries.  Yet, gauge symmetries are\nprecisely the reason that each type of matter ($Q$, $u$, $d$, $L$, $e$) \nis tied with the other matter fields together in a self-consistent, \nexclusive fashion.  In addition, non-chiral matter allows a new mass \nscale unconnected to electroweak symmetry breaking that only further \ncomplicates our understanding of mass generation and mass hierarchies.\nExtensions of the SM with non-chiral matter, such as adding right-handed \nneutrinos, therefore appear to be contrary to all of the guiding wisdom  \ngleaned from experiment, at least until recently.\n(Those who are still in doubt need only observe the agony that \nthe $\\mu$ problem causes avatars of supersymmetry.)\nNeutrino experiments \\cite{superk,sno,kamland}, \nhowever, have firmly established that \nthe neutrinos oscillate between each generation and thus they\nhave mass.  The largest mass of any one neutrino is constrained \nto be less than about 2 eV \\cite{mass}, and more likely their mass is \none to a few orders of magnitude below this, depending on the generation.\nThe mechanism of mass generation for neutrinos remains a mystery.\nIf neutrinos acquire mass analogously to the SM matter fermions, preserving\nlepton number, then the particle content\nmust be extended with at least two right-handed neutrinos $\\nu_{1,2}$.\nOrdinary Yukawa terms ${\\cal L} = \\lambda_\\nu L H \\nu^c$ with tiny \ncouplings $\\lambda_\\nu \\lsim 10^{-12}$ suffice to explain the two \nundisputed mass differences found in neutrino oscillation experiments.  \nBut, the global symmetry behind lepton number conservation is not \nexpected to be exact.\nAt dimension-5, the operator $H L H L/M$ violates lepton number \nby two units and leads to a tiny Majorana mass $v^2/M$ for \nleft-handed neutrinos.  This transmutes the neutrino mass \nhierarchy problem from explaining $\\lambda_\\nu \\lsim 10^{-12}$ to \ninstead explaining $v/M \\lsim 10^{-12}$.\nTo embrace the dimension-5 neutrino mass explanation means the SM \neffective theory breaks down at $M \\lsim 10^{14}$ GeV[SEP]", "[PAD]\\importpackages{}\n\\graphicspath{ {./images/} }\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\\begin{center}Jan P.

Every manifold that admits a minimal flow admits also a minimal homeomorphism. The converse does not hold even in dimension 2, as manifested on the Klein bottle \\cite{Parry}. Less is known about the existence of minimal noninvertible maps. The circle does not admit such maps, despite admitting minimal rotations \\cite{AK}. \nBoth the 2-torus and Klein bottle admit minimal noninvertible maps \\cite{KST}, \\cite{Sotola}, but in dimension at least $3$ it has not been known which manifolds admit minimal noninvertible maps.
